    "- If you have more than these two files, put any additional files in a directory named `EECS491-A1-yourcaseid`. Do not include binaries or large data files. Then zip this directory and submit it with the name `EECS491-A1-yourcaseid.zip`.  Do not use other compression formats.  The `.ipynb` file can be included in the zipped directory, but make sure you submit the `.pdf` file along with the `.zip` file.  This is so it appears at the top level on canvas, which allows for easier grading."

Demonstrates a deeper level of understanding. | Problem also illustrates or clarifies common conceptual difficulties or misconceptions. |\n",

    "| <b> Clarity of Explanation </b> | Little or confusing explanation; figures lack labels or useful captions; no explanation of motivations. | Explanations are present, but unclear, unfocused, wordy or contain too much technical detail. | Clear and concise explanations of key ideas and motivations. | Also clear and concise, but includes illustrative figures; could be read and understood by students from a variety of backgrounds. |\n",
    "| <b> Depth of Exploration </b> | Content is obvious or closely imitates assignment problems. | Uses existing problem for different data. | Applies a variation of a technique to solve a problem with an interesting motivation; explores a concept in a series of related problems. | Applies several concepts or techniques; has clear focus of inquiry that is approached from multiple directions.|"
