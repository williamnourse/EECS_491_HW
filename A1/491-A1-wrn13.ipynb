One of the dispensers is chosen at random. If $a$ is the probability that the first candy given is red, and $b$ is the probability that the second candy given is red, these probabilities are not independent since depending on the first candy we can infer which machine we are pulling from. However if we know which dispenser we are pulling from ($c$), then $a$ and $b$ are no longer independent."

Show the likelihood equation and plot it for three different values of $\\lambda$: less, about equal, and greater than what you estimate (intuitively) from the data. (5 pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "5.2 Derive the posterior distribution of $\\lambda$ assuming a Gamma prior (usually defined with parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$).  The posterior should have the form $p(\\lambda | n, T, \\alpha, \\beta)$ where $T$ is the total duration of the observation period and $n$ is the number of events observed within that period.
